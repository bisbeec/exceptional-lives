					<h2 class="blueText">In 2012 we met at Harvard and recognized our shared dedication to helping families of children with disabilities gain better access to services and supports. We knew disability information was available, but that much of it was too general or inaccessible for families who needed it. To solve this problem, we began collaborating on technology solutions that could empower families with access to essential information, tailored to their individual situations. In 2013, we launched Exceptional Lives.</h2>
